# 3dprintable_nexus6_wallet_case_openscad
 A 3d printable customizable wallet case for OnePlus 3/3T designed with OpenSCAD

Optimized for Semiflex/Cheetah. Ninjaflex will probaly work, too.
Some softer types of PLA may work, but the hinge can break eventually.

Customizable types: Wallet Case, Flip Case, Bumper
Customizable text: You can add your own name or signature in customizer, by default its "OnePlus"

Default settings:
Wallet Case with 3 credit card pockets, one extra pocket and an integrated stand.

We all suffer from bad bed adhision from time to time, why not use it to our advantage?
When adding a small air gap between layers they still adhere during printing but can be seperated to form pockets :-)
I used Simplify3D, not tested with other slicers.

If you have problems separating the layers add a small piece of tape at the air gaps during printing.
Usually its enough to have a 3mm wide opening to insert a screw driver and successively open the pocket.
I used a piece of kapton tape for the stand only. If you use too much tape the layers may separate during printing which can cause deformation or a failed print.

You should use a flexible material for flip and wallet case styles, as the hinge can break after some time with harder materials.
Optimized for Semiflex/Cheetah, but successfully used Taulman PCTPE, too (which is a combination of Nylon and TPE).
